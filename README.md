[![MapLibre Logo](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-navigation-ios/blob/main/.github/splash-image-ios.png?raw=true)](https://maplibre.org)

The Maplibre Navigation SDK for iOS is built on a fork of the [Mapbox Navigation SDK v0.21](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-navigation-ios/tree/v0.21.0) which is build on top of the [Mapbox Directions API](https://www.mapbox.com/directions) (v0.23.0) and contains logic needed to get timed navigation instructions.

With this SDK you can implement turn by turn navigation in your own iOS app while hosting your own Map tiles and Directions API.

# Why have we forked

1. Mapbox decided to put a closed source component to their navigation SDK and introduced a non open source license. Maplibre wants an open source solution.
2. Mapbox decided to put telemetry in their SDK. We couldn't turn this off without adjusting the source.
3. We want to use the SDK without paying Mapbox for each MAU and without Mapbox API keys.

All issues are covered with this SDK. 

# What have we changed

- Removed EventManager and all its references, this manager collected telemetry data which we don't want to send
- Transitioned from the [Mapbox SDK](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native-ios) (version 4.3) to [Maplibre Maps SDK](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-native) (version 6.0.0)
- Added optional config parameter in NavigationMapView constructor to customize certain properties like route line color

# Getting Started

If you are looking to include this inside your project, you have to follow the the following steps:

Install this package using the [Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/documentation/package-manager/).

1. Open your project in Xcode.
1. -> File -> Add Package Dependencies
1. Enter the URL of this repository into the search field: https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-navigation-ios
  1. Press "Add Package".
  1. In the modal, update "Add to Target" to include your application.
  1. Complete the installation by pressing "Add Package".
1. Add properties to `Info.plist`
   - MGLMapboxAccessToken / String / Leave empty = Ensures that the SDK doesn't crash
   - MGLMapboxAPIBaseURL / String / Add url = Url that is being used to GET the navigation JSON
   - NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription / String / Add a description = Needed for the location permission
1. [optional] When app is running on device and you're having problems: Add `arm64` to `PROJECT -> <Project naam> -> Build Settings -> Excluded Architecture Only`
1. Use the sample code as inspiration

# Getting Help

## <a name="sample-code">Sample code

A demo app is currently not available. Please check the Mapbox repository or documentation for examples, especially on the forked version. You can try the provided demo app, which you need to first run `carthage update --platform iOS --use-xcframeworks` for in the root of this project.

In order to see the map or calculate a route you need your own Maptile and Direction services.

Use the following code as inspiration:

```
import MapLibre
import MapboxDirections
import MapboxCoreNavigation
import MapboxNavigation

class ViewController: UIViewController {
    var navigationView: NavigationMapView?
    
    // Keep `RouteController` in memory (class scope),
    // otherwise location updates won't be triggered
    public var mapboxRouteController: RouteController?
    
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        
        let navigationView = NavigationMapView(
            frame: .zero,
            // Tile loading can take a while
            styleURL: URL(string: "your style URL here"),
            config: MNConfig())
        self.navigationView = navigationView
        view.addSubview(navigationView)
        navigationView.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
        navigationView.topAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.topAnchor).isActive = true
        navigationView.bottomAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.bottomAnchor).isActive = true

        navigationView.trailingAnchor.constraint(equalTo: view.trailingAnchor).isActive = true
